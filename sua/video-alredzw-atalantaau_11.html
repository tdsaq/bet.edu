On the other hand, Wydad Casablanca, hailing from Casablanca, Morocco, has also left an indelible mark on African football. Founded in 1937, Wydad has won multiple Moroccan league titles, domestic cups, and has enjoyed remarkable continental success. They have clinched the CAF Champions League title twice, the last of which came in 2017.
